##### Abstract

  Spatial behavior rarely takes place in the wild, but deals mostly with finding intersections, reading signs and maps, or following verbal instruction. Studies have shown that both humans and animals form mental representations of the environment through exploration (Behrens et al., 2018). The main reason for so-called cognitive maps (Tolman, 1948) would be to allow planning novel routes and to form embodied descriptions of the external world. The idea that we learn through searching by taking some actions seems to be one of the first that occurs when we think about the nature of learning. So far, the best answer to such learning-through-searching abilities has been simulated by reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018), because of the emphasis on learning from direct interactions with the environment without relying on exemplary supervision. An artificial agent interacting with an unreliable and dynamic environment is able to simulate intelligence represented by the ability to complete a given task in an optimal way. This framework provides a potential knowledge base to test strategies within a framework that people and machines use to actively explore the world. Such exploratory behavior can be characterized by decision making processes by which they select actions facing reward or punishment in environments which is especially needed to build a model of the world that we can understand as a cognitive map (Peterson and Verstynen, 2021).  Nevertheless, how should we know whether our current knowledge is reliable enough to make predictions about optimal ways? 

  In the paper, a model of reinforcement learning algorithm explores space in a grid-maze environment within its confusing structure consisting of complex branching with choices of path and direction guided from entrance to some goal. It is hypothesized that through such complex environment navigation, an agent similar to humans, creates internal graph-based representation of space with additional metric information in order to be able to perform flexible behavior patterns. Such a model that would use both cognitive map and graph framework may provide a fundamental understanding of mechanisms underlying generation of representations of space (Peer et al., 2021). Such parallel learning could underlie human ability to conceptualize, represent world structure and navigate in both spatial and non-spatial tasks.
