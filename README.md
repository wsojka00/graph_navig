##### Abstract

Both humans and animals use mental representations of the environment during active exploration and create a so-called cognitive map (Tolman, 1948) for the purpose of planning novel routes and modeling the external world. So far, the best answer to the idea that we learn through search by taking some actions has been simulated by reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018), because of its emphasis on learning from direct interactions with the environment without relying on exemplary supervision. Such a framework in which an agent is interacting with an unreliable and dynamic environment is able to simulate intelligence represented by the ability to complete a given task in an optimal way. However, which structural characteristic should a cognitive map have, in order to perform navigation in the most efficient way and to overcome uncertainty whether to perform further exploration or exploitation? In order to provide an insight into possible answers, I apply a reinforcement learning algorithm that explores in a grid-maze environment within its confusing structure consisting of complex branching. Through such a complex navigation process, I propose that an agent creates an internal graph-based representation of space that aims to allow flexible behavior patterns within the structure capturing relationships between different states. Graphs provide a clear framework that can capture both metric and relational information encoded by brain cells of entorhinal-hippocampal circuitry (Behrens et al., 2018). Such parallel encoding may underlie human ability to navigate in space, represent the world structure and conceptualize in both spatial and non-spatial tasks.
