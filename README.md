##### Abstract

Humans and animals succeed in searching through various complex environments. Back in the thirties, Tolman argued that such abilities arise from the construction of “cognitive maps” through exploration. Such maps enable active mapping of real-world environments to simplified cognitive representations. Although, this theory is widely accepted and studied, the way of how different cognitive maps are stored in the brain is still discussed. Some authors proposed that cognitive maps represent the environment as Euclidean space, but in my thesis I provide evidences that support the hypothesis that graph-theoretical approach provide a more robust framework that additionally allows for behavior flexibility. Here, I investigate a potential of reinforcement learning algorithms trained in navigation of different environments to construct an internal graph-based representation of these spaces. An ability to form a cognitive map in parallel with real-time exploration may underlie human ability to navigate in various spaces, represent the world structure and generalize to novel tasks.
